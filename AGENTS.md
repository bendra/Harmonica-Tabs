# Project Guidance for Codex

- This project is didactic; explain best practices as they come up.
- Prefer simple, beginner-friendly steps and explanations.
- Keep changes small and incremental.
- Ask before making large architectural or tooling changes.
- Prioritize clarity and correctness over cleverness.
- If core decisions change, update `docs/STATE.md` and `docs/TODO.md`.
- Use best practices and value honesty over affirmation; challenge decisions that seem unwise (final decision remains with the user).
- Prefer one chat per coherent goal; start a new chat when the goal/context shifts.
